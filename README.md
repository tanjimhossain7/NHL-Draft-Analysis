# Predicting NHL Draft Success 📊🏒

This project analyzes NHL draft data to understand what makes a player successful and builds a predictive model to forecast career impact (point shares). Visualizations and an interactive dashboard were created to support data-driven decisions.

## 📂 Files
- `nhl_draft_analysis.ipynb`: Python notebook for cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling
- `cleaned_nhl_draft_for_dashboard.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for dashboards
- `dashboard.pbix` (optional): Power BI dashboard file
- `images/`: Screenshots of dashboard and plots

## 🚀 Highlights
- Cleaned 12,000+ player records, filtered for completeness
- Created custom metrics like `points_per_game`, `penalty_rate`
- Visualized trends by position, nationality, age, and draft pick
- Trained a linear regression model to predict player value
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for product-style exploration

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- Higher picks tend to have more value, but not always
- Younger draftees and lower penalty rates correlated with success
- U.S. and Canadian players dominate per-game stats

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI Web / Tableau Public
- Jupyter Notebook
